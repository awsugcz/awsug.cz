# How to add+share my presentation

I would like to ask all speakers to upload their presenation to the GiHub
the following way:

* Fork the repository from the
  [https://github.com/awsugcz/awsug.cz](https://github.com/awsugcz/awsug.cz)
  (top right ```Fork``` button).

* Clone forked repository from your personal GitHub account
  and create the branch:

  ```bash
  cd /tmp
  git clone git@github.com:ruzickap/awsug.cz.git
  cd awsug.cz
  git checkout -b feature/add_presentation remotes/origin/main
  ```

* Copy your presentation to the directory inside Git repository.
  The presentation file name should looks like
  "`<date>-<name_surname>-<presentation_name>.pdf`":

  ```bash
  cp ~/presentations/my_presentation.pdf static/presentations/2017-12-12/2017-09-20-Vladimir_Simek-Running_Docker_Containers_on_AWS.pdf
  ```

* Please put your name + contact details here (the **order** of the speakers
  should be **preserved**):

  ```bash
  vi static/presentations/README.md
  ```

* Lastly - add your name and presentation title here (the **order** of the
  speakers should be **preserved**):

  ```bash
  vi static/presentations/2017-12-12/README.md
  ```

* Check + add all modified files to the git repository and push it back
  to GitHub:

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

  ```text
  On branch feature/add_presentation
  Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.

  Changes not staged for commit:
    (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
    (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)

          modified:   static/presentations/2017-12-12/README.md

  Untracked files:
    (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

          static/presentations/2017-12-12/2017-09-20-Vladimir_Simek-Running_Docker_Containers_on_AWS.pdf

  no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
  ```

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m  "Adding presentation from 2017-09-20 by Vladimir Simek - Running Docker Containers on AWS"
  ```
